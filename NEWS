MIMOSA 0.9.12
=============
* MIMOSA now returns a MIMOSAResultList S3 class.
  A lightweight wrapper for a list, with methods defined to extract the `fdr` and `pData`, `getW`, and `getZ` to extract the component weights and posterior probabilities, respectively.
* `print` for `MIMOSAResult` and `MIMOSAResultList`
* extractors for `countsTable`, the table of counts used to fit the model. Takes an argument to return the proportions or the counts.
* MIMOSA checks throws a more informative warning if the data is filtered into oblivion when not properly paired (e.g. when the user doesn't aggregate over replicate negative controls, for example. )
* `volcanoPlot` implemented for MIMOSAResultList 

MIMOSA 0.9.9
============
* Bug Fixes
** Filtered out empty categories on the conditioning variables.
** Support for parallel as well as multicore

* News
** multicore support (via the multicore package) will be phased out in favor of the parallel package.

* Data represented via an ExpressionSet
* Formula interface support
* Removed old code, including ICS class, and dependencies upon it.
* New documentation

MIMOSA 0.7.0
============
* First beta release of MIMOSA
