MIMOSA: Mixture Models for Single Cell Assays

MIMOSA is a package for fitting mixtures of beta-binomial or dirichlet-multinomial models to paired count data from single-cell assays, as typically appear in immunological studies (i.e. ICS, intracellular cytokine staining assay, or Fluidigm Biomark single-cell gene expression assays). 

MIMOSA is, generally, more sensitive and specific to detect differences between conditions (i.e. stimulated vs. unstimulated samples) than alternative approaches such as Fisher's exact test, or empirical ad-hoc methods like ranking by log-fold change.

We have recently cleaned up the MIMOSA package. Older unused implementations have been hidden, and the user-facing interface has been unified to use the 'MIMOSA' function to fit data. Data is represented by 'ExpressionSet' objects from 'Biobase'. See the vignette for an example.

MIMOSA shares information across subjects by means of priors on the proportions of stimulated and unstimulated cells, respectively.
